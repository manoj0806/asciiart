# asciiart

Instructions to run :
Clone the repo or download it onto local pc,
Run the ascii.py file 
Enter the path or the image name you want to covert to art format.

I have attached the input img and the ouput img.
The code also generates a output.txt which contains the image in raw txt format.


Note:use jpg images for better results.
